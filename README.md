# ConcurrentModificationException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the ConcurrentModificationException. This exception occurs when a collection is modified while iterating over it using an iterator that does not support concurrent modification. 

The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionExample.java` file contains code that throws this exception. The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionSolution.java` file shows how to avoid this error using an iterator that supports concurrent modification.
